  <h3 align="center">Knights Tour</h3>

  <div align="justify">
    <p>
      A GUI application built with Java Swing that demonstrates a heuristic approach to solving the knight's tour problem on an 8x8 chessboard. The application offers three modes: auto, guided, and manual, catering to different ways of solving or exploring the problem.

    <p>
      The knight's tour problem involves finding a sequence of moves for a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. Squirrel's algorithm provides a heuristic to solve this problem efficiently.

## Modes
- **Auto Mode**: Automatically solves the knight's tour problem without user intervention.
- **Guided Mode**: Guides the user by suggesting which cell to move next to solve the knight's tour.
- **Manual Mode**: Allows the user to solve the knight's tour themselves, turning it into a game-like experience.

## Features
- GUI interface built with Java Swing for interactive visualization.
- Implements Squirrel's algorithm heuristic for solving the knight's tour problem.
- Board size: 8x8 chessboard.
